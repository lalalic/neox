Open it with:
  open "${INSTALLED:-$APP}"

It will appear in the menu bar. Use Start, then "Copy ChatGPT Setup".

The app reads mcp-http.mjs from $PACKAGE_DIR (its own parent directory), keeps
the bearer token in a mode-0600 file at
  ~/Library/Application Support/MacDeveloperBridge/http-token
and passes it to the front end by file, so the token stays out of ps output.

Start writes the full-access unlock file; Stop and Quit remove it, which makes
stopping fail-closed rather than only killing a process.
