To grant it (requires your password; no scripted path exists):

  System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Full Disk Access -> +

On the Cloudflare/HTTP transport, add the APP BUNDLE, not the binaries:

  /Applications/MacDevBridge.app

Measured on this machine: granting Full Disk Access to the bundle alone produced
GRANTED for both node and zsh, with no separate TCC entries for either, because
macOS attributes access to the responsible process and the chain is

  MacDevBridge.app -> node -> zsh

The control that makes this conclusive is that Terminal was NOT granted access, yet
the check still passed — so the grant was genuinely inherited from the app rather
than from the shell the check was typed into. Add the individual binaries only if the
app bundle alone leaves a row MISSING.

Binaries are hidden in the file picker: press Cmd-Shift-G and paste the path.

Three further things people get wrong:

  1. Granting FDA to Terminal does NOT cover a LaunchAgent-spawned process.
     The grant is per-executable, and launchd children get their own attribution.
  2. A version-managed node path changes when you switch versions. If you
     upgrade Node, re-add the new path and re-run this check.
  3. This check describes the session it ran from, because TCC attributes
     access to the responsible parent process. To test the chain that actually
     serves ChatGPT, run this script *through the bridge*:
       shell_exec -> scripts/tcc-doctor.sh

After granting, restart whichever transport supervises the bridge so the new
permission is picked up. For the Cloudflare/HTTP transport that is the HTTP
front end (mcp-http.mjs); for the OpenAI Tunnel transport it is tunnel-client:

  Tunnel transport (a LaunchAgent exists):
    launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/<the label you installed>"
  Cloudflare/HTTP transport (no LaunchAgent exists):
    use Stop then Start in the MacDevBridge menu bar app

Listing what is actually loaded:

  launchctl list | grep mac-developer-bridge
TXT

if [[ "${1:-}" == "--open" ]]; then
